This is a list of things to do with this project

- [ ] add requirements.txt
- [ ] add more comments to the code
- [ ] switch *record_trace* to True* when the Fock backend will support returning state
- [ ] add some trace loss when it will be possible to calculate a derivative of the state
- [ ] a picture with a schematic representation of the architecture
- [ ] test this architecture on more complicated tasks
- [ ] write a paper about this architecture :)
